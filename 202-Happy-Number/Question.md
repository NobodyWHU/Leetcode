# 202. Happy Number

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1\. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:Â **19 is a happy number

*   1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82
*   8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68
*   6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100
*   1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1
