# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note:**  
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Follow up:**  
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

**Hint:**

2.  What if you could modify the BST node's structure?[Show More Hint](#)
3.  The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
