# 115. Distinct Subsequences

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/)

Given a string **S** and a string **T**, count the number of distinct subsequences of **T** in **S**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

Here is an example:  
**S** = `"rabbbit"`, **T** = `"rabbit"`

Return `3`.
