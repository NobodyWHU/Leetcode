# 127. Word Ladder

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

Given two words (_beginWord_ and _endWord_), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:

1.  Only one letter can be changed at a time
2.  Each intermediate word must exist in the word list

For example,

Given:  
_beginWord_ = `"hit"`  
_endWord_ = `"cog"`  
_wordList_ = `["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`  

As one shortest transformation is `"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"`,  
return its length `5`.

**Note:**  

*   Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
*   All words have the same length.
*   All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
