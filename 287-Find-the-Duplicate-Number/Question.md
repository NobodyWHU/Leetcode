# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Given an array _nums_ containing _n_ + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and _n_ (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Note:**  

1.  You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2.  You must use only constant, _O_(1) extra space.
3.  Your runtime complexity should be less than `O(n<sup>2</sup>)`.
4.  There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
