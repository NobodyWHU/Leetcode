# 363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-sub-matrix-no-larger-than-k/)

Given a non-empty 2D matrix _matrix_ and an integer _k_, find the max sum of a rectangle in the _matrix_ such that its sum is no larger than _k_.

**Example:**  

<pre>Given matrix = [
  [1,  0, 1],
  [0, -2, 3]
]
k = 2
</pre>

The answer is `2`. Because the sum of rectangle `[[0, 1], [-2, 3]]` is 2 and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).

**Note:**  

1.  The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
2.  What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
