# 112. Path Sum

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

For example:  
Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

<pre>              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
</pre>

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.
