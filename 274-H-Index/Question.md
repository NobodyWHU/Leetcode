# 274. H-Index

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index _h_ if _h_ of his/her _N_ papers have **at least** _h_ citations each, and the other _N âˆ’ h_ papers have **no more than** _h_ citations each."

For example, given `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, which means the researcher has `5` papers in total and each of them had received `3, 0, 6, 1, 5` citations respectively. Since the researcher has `3` papers with **at least** `3` citations each and the remaining two with **no more than** `3` citations each, his h-index is `3`.

**Note**: If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
