# 365. Water and Jug Problem

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/)

You are given two jugs with capacities _x_ and _y_ litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly _z_ litres using these two jugs.

If _z_ liters of water is measurable, you must have _z_ liters of water contained within **one or both buckets** by the end.

Operations allowed:

*   Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
*   Empty any of the jugs.
*   Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.

**Example 1:** (From the famous [_"Die Hard"_ example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVtQNK_ZUJg))

<pre>Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
Output: True
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
Output: False
</pre>
