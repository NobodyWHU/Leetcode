# 207. Course Schedule

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

There are a total of _n_ courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

<pre>2, [[1,0]]</pre>

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0\. So it is possible.

<pre>2, [[1,0],[0,1]]</pre>

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1\. So it is impossible.

**Note:**  
The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).

<div class="spoilers" style="display: block;">**Hints:**

1.  This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
2.  [Topological Sort via DFS](https://class.coursera.org/algo-003/lecture/52) - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.
3.  Topological sort could also be done via [BFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Algorithms).
