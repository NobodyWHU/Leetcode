# 343. Integer Break

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/)

Given a positive integer _n_, break it into the sum of **at least** two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

For example, given _n_ = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given _n_ = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).

**Note**: you may assume that _n_ is not less than 2.
