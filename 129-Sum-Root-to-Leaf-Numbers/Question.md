# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

Given a binary tree containing digits from `0-9` only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number `123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

<pre>    1
   / \
  2   3
</pre>

The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.  
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.
