# 134. Gas Station

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

There are _N_ gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station _i_ is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station _i_ to its next station (_i_+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**  
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
