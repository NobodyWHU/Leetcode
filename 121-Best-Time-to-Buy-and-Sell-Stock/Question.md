# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

Say you have an array for which the _i_<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

**Example 1:**  

<pre>Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
</pre>

**Example 2:**  

<pre>Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</pre>
